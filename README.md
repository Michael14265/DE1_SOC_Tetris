# Classic Tetris Game on DE1-SoC HPS

This project implements a classic Tetris game on the DE1-SoC development board. The repository includes the embedded C code executed on the ARM SoC, which communicates with the VGA subsystem to ensure accurate graphical output. A demonstration video showcasing the functionality of the Tetris game is linked below.

The game runs via the command line interface and allows user interaction through keystrokes to control the game pieces.
